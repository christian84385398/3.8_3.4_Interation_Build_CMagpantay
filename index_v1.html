	<h1>About The Tour</h1>
	<p>Our tour operates in an outdoor environment that is always changing, where there are inherent risks and where conditions can alter quickly.  The tour route can be subject to unpredictable slips, rockfalls, rough and rugged terrain and other naturally occurring hazards.  The recent QRA report (jointly commissioned by Hastings District Council and Dept. of Conservation) states the safest way to experience the beach route to Cape Kidnappers is with our organised tour to ‘take advantage of local knowledge and reduced exposure time’.</p></div>
	
	
	<div class = "content_4"><h1></h1><p>Our unique and fun eco-experience will see you travel with our experienced local guides by vintage tractors and trailers on a comfortable 4-hour adventure discovering the wonders of the local coastline and heading out to the largest mainland gannet colony in the world! There’ll be lots of Wow! moments and some great pic’s to be taken. You won’t want to miss our exclusively ‘Kiwi’ adventure while you are in Hawke’s Bay.</p></div>
