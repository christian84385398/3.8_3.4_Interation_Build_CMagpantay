<div class = "box_4"><h1>The Geology</h1><p>The stretch of coastline from Clifton to Cape Kidnappers is an area of fascinating geological history, dating back around 300,000 years at Clifton to approx. 4.5 million years at the Cape, which is visible in the dramatic cliff faces that line the beach along which we travel.  In places the cliffs tower above us, and the different layers of sedimentary material is easy to see – looking back along the beach as we travel shows how the land has slumped from tectonic movement.  View ancient earthquake faultlines, fossils, gullies formed by wind & water – you don’t have to be a geologist to enjoy this! You will be amazed by the incredible cliffs and the stories they hold, but be aware they are often on the move with this seismic country of ours – the area is subject to unpredictable slips and rockfalls and is also in a tsunami risk zone.</p></div>
<div class = "box_5"><h1>Department of conservation reserve</h1><p>The Department of Conservation (DOC) Reserve encompasses 13 hectares and is situated at the far end of the beach.  This area has recently been downgraded by DOC to a back country track, which means that it will be maintained to a lower standard than it was previously.

The rest shelter is well equipped with toilets and picnic tables located under shady trees. Also provided are interpretation boards on the area and gannets. We are the only DOC concessionaire operating in the area, and a percentage of each fare is paid to them for the preservation of New Zealand’s natural assets.

Note:  You must take all rubbish away with you as there are no bins provided in the Reserve.</p></div>

<div class = " box_6"><h1>Cape Sanctuary</h1><p>The Cape Sanctuary is located on the Cape Kidnappers peninsula, running over several working farm stations and includes the famous Cape Kidnappers Golf Course.  It was established in 2006 and covers an area of 2,500 hectares.  The predator fence (the end of which can be seen from the beach) travels down to Ocean Beach to the south of Cape Kidnappers, covering a distance of 10.5km.  Along with bait stations and traps, this fence helps keep predators to a minimum within the Sanctuary. The staff and volunteers are doing an amazing job of successfully reintroducing both forest and sea birdlife here – including kiwi and tuatara – which once would have roamed the area in abundance.</p></div>
<div class = " box_7"><h1>About us</h1>We are a locally owned and operated family business who take pride in offering an experience you will never forget – whether it be because your tractor got stuck, your feet got wet, you saw a penguin or orca that day, you gagged on the smell of the guano, or were just amazed at how much there was to learn! We often have people coming back time and time again, bringing their children then grandchildren along to experience our unique adventure.

Model T Fords, old trucks and buggies were first used to transport people along the beach, but as a result of the corrosive effects of the harsh environment, tractors were introduced around 1969.

Our fleet of six Minneapolis-Moline tractors are true vintage classics, most of whom have been working hard on the beach for around 50 years.  Each unit consists of two trailers, which are purpose built for comfort, safety and maneuverability.

Our family of drivers consists of a wide range of personalities, all of whom have a passion for the Cape and the local area in general. They are guaranteed to give you:<p></p></div>
